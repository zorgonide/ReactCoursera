This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

> Built a restaurant website using ReactJs Framework as a Single Page Application, utilizing ReactStrap library for Bootstrap 4, and Redux for managing application state. A basic JSON-server was used with REST API.

## Quick Start



```bash
# Install json-server   
npm install json-server -g

# At any convenient location on your computer, create a new folder named json-server, and move to this folder.
# Move the db.json file provided in repo to this folder. Move to this folder in your terminal window, 
# and type the following at the command prompt to start the server:

# Run server at localhost:3001
json-server --watch .\db.json -d 2000 -p 3001

# Back to repository, install dependencies
